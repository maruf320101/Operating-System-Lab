Automated User & Group Management System
Operating Systems Lab Project — System Design Overview

1. Project Overview

This project implements a command-line tool designed to automate the management of users and groups on a Linux system. It provides an interactive menu-driven interface for system administrators to add, delete, modify users and groups efficiently.

2. System Workflow Diagram Explained

2.1 User Initiates the Script:
The system administrator launches the script from the Linux terminal. The script operates entirely in the command-line interface (CLI), ensuring broad compatibility without a graphical environment.

2.2 Interactive Menu Display:
Upon execution, the script presents a clear, easy-to-navigate menu listing all available operations such as:

A. Add User
B. Delete User
C. Modify User
D. Create Group
E. Add User to Group
F.  View All Users
G. View All Groups
H. Send msg user
  I. Send Grp msg 
 J. Exit

This menu guides the user through the management process, making complex system administration tasks accessible.

2.3 User Selects an Operation:
The administrator inputs their choice corresponding to a menu option. The system validates this input to prevent invalid or unintended commands.

2.4 Execution of Chosen Action:
Based on the user’s selection, the script executes appropriate Linux commands (useradd, groupadd, usermod, etc.). Robust error handling ensures the system gracefully manages scenarios such as duplicate user creation or non-existent groups.

2.5 Feedback and Confirmation:
After the action completes, the script displays a success or failure message to keep the administrator informed of the system’s status.

2.6 Return to Main Menu:
The system loops back to the main menu, allowing the administrator to perform multiple tasks seamlessly without restarting the script. An exit option is always available to terminate the session safely.

3. Why This Design is Effective for the Lab Project

3.1 Intuitive and Clear Workflow:
The step-by-step process ensures users understand and can predict system behavior, fostering ease of use.

3.2 Modular and Maintainable:
Each function corresponds to a menu option, simplifying debugging and future feature enhancements.

3.3 User-Friendly Command-Line Interface:
The interactive CLI reduces the learning curve for users unfamiliar with all Linux commands.

3.4 Real-World Relevance:
Covers fundamental concepts of user and group management essential for any Linux system administrator.

3.5 Flexible and Extendable:
The loop-back design supports continuous operation and easy addition of new features.

4. Additional Enhancements to Consider

4.1 Action Logging: 
Maintain logs for auditing all user and group management activities.

4.2 Automated Backup: 
Implement regular backups of user configuration files to prevent data loss.

4.3 Password Policy Enforcement: 
Integrate checks to enforce password complexity and expiration.

4.4 Enhanced UI: 
Use tools like dialog or whiptail to provide a graphical-like menu interface in the terminal.

5. Final Thoughts
This project not only reinforces core Linux administration skills but also demonstrates practical automation using Bash scripting. It’s an excellent foundation for deeper exploration into operating system security and management.
